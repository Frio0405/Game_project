# Game_project
This is my first project on Python. I made it to improve and practice my object- oriented programming skills and have some fun. 

# Vent shaft
It is a simple 2D horror game(at least it is meant to be a horror game), where player has to escape from a vent shaft using different tools like radar and audio.

# Main features
1. Grid- base movement, the vent shaft includes many blocks
2. Monster reacts to player's actions
3. There are also radar and audio mechanics
4. Basic GUI with a play button

# Development and game run
I used Pycharm to write code for my game. I also installed pygame package to realise the game.
